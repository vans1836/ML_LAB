# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques: Comparative Analysis

## Objective:
This report presents a comparative analysis of four dimensionality reduction techniques (SVD, PCA, Isomap, and MDS) applied to the Spambase dataset. The goal is to understand the effectiveness of each technique in preserving the original data structure and how well they perform in clustering.

---

## 1. Data Preprocessing

The Spambase dataset was first preprocessed using standard scaling and normalization techniques. The features were scaled to ensure that they were on the same scale and normalized to improve the effectiveness of the dimensionality reduction methods.

### d. **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**
- **Visualization:**
    - Provide the 2D or 3D visualizations for MDS output.
    - Example:
    ```python
    # Add the image or plot here when you generate it in the notebook
    ```

## 3. Clustering Comparisons

After applying each dimensionality reduction technique, K-means clustering was used to cluster the data in the reduced space. Below is a comparison of the clustering results based on different techniques:

### a. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
- **Clustering Result:** 
    - Provide K-means clustering results and performance metrics for SVD.
    - Example:
    ```python
    # Add the result of the clustering evaluation here
    ```

### b. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Clustering Result:** 
    - Provide K-means clustering results and performance metrics for PCA.
    - Example:
    ```python
    # Add the result of the clustering evaluation here
    ```

### c. **Isomap**
- **Clustering Result:** 
    - Provide K-means clustering results and performance metrics for Isomap.
    - Example:
    ```python
    # Add the result of the clustering evaluation here
    ```

### d. **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**
- **Clustering Result:** 
    - Provide K-means clustering results and performance metrics for MDS.
    - Example:
    ```python
    # Add the result of the clustering evaluation here
    ```

## 4. Discussion

### Advantages and Limitations of Each Method

**Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):**
- **Advantages:**
    - Reduces data dimensionality effectively.
    - Works well when the data matrix is well-structured.
- **Limitations:**
    - May lose interpretability with high-dimensional datasets.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
- **Advantages:**
    - Captures the variance in the data effectively.
    - Fast and efficient for large datasets.
- **Limitations:**
    - May struggle with non-linear relationships.

**Isomap:**
- **Advantages:**
    - Captures non-linear relationships.
    - Useful for preserving geodesic distances.
- **Limitations:**
    - May be computationally expensive for large datasets.

**Multidimensional Scaling (MDS):**
- **Advantages:**
    - Useful for visualizing the structure of high-dimensional data.
    - Preserves pairwise distances between points.
- **Limitations:**
    - Can be slow on large datasets
